This Flask application allows users to upload images and detect facial attributes like age and gender using pre-trained deep learning models.

# Features:

- Image Upload: Users can upload images through a web interface.
- Facial Detection: The application detects faces within the uploaded image.
- Age and Gender Prediction: For each detected face, the application predicts the age range and gender.
- Real-time Processing: Processing happens on the server-side.

# Requirements:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- dlib (optional, for more advanced face detection)
- cv2-dnn (for importing pre-trained age/gender models)
- Base64
- Jinja2 (for templating, likely already installed with Flask)

# Pre-trained Models:

- Download pre-trained models for face detection, age prediction, and gender prediction. Popular options include:
  - Face detection: Haar cascades (included in OpenCV)
  - Age prediction: Age Net (deploy_age.prototxt, age_net.caffemodel)
  - Gender prediction: Gender Net (deploy_gender.prototxt, gender_net.caffemodel)

# Running the Application:

1. Download and install the required libraries.
2. Place the pre-trained models in the appropriate directory within the project structure.
3. Run the application using `python app.py`.

# API Endpoint:

- `/`: Renders the HTML template for the web interface.
- `/upload` (POST): Accepts uploaded image files, performs facial attribute detection, and returns a JSON response with results (bounding boxes, age, gender) and a base64 encoded image with drawn detections.

# Web Interface (index.html - not included):

The `index.html` file should include an HTML form that allows users to upload an image file. Upon submission, the form should send a POST request to the `/upload` endpoint with the image data.

# Example Usage:

1. Access the application in your web browser (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
2. Select an image file and upload it.
3. The application will process the image and display the results:
   - Detected faces with bounding boxes.
   - Predicted age range and gender for each face.

# Note:

- This is a basic example and can be extended to support additional features like emotion recognition, facial landmarks detection, or integrating with different deep learning frameworks.
- Consider adding comments within the code for better understanding.

# Further Improvements:

- Implement error handling for invalid file types or large image sizes.
- Use a frontend framework like Bootstrap for a more polished user interface.
- Explore more advanced face detection and deep learning models for improved accuracy.
